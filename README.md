This is inteded only for my dissertation experiments and it is not intended to be merged into benchexec or maintained. If you need any help with benchexec please go to: [BenchExec Github](https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec)

That being said this fork integrates `test2c` tool which is only used by my scripts, so it shouldn't affect any validation by benchexec
